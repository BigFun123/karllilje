            <h1>Gravity is Particle Occlusion</h1>
            <h2>Karl Lilje, 2016</h3>
                <h4>Gravity is a phenomenon caused by the occlusion of particles between atoms.</h4>
                <p>There are fewer particles between atoms than outside the couplet, resulting in a relative particle
                    vacuum
                    between atoms. Particles push the atoms together.</p>
                <br>
                <p> This page will illustrate and demonstate WHY gravity works, and propose ideas and applications on
                    particle occluders that can increase the velocity maxima of suborbital, superorbital, and
                    interstellar vehicles.</p>
                <p>Particle occlusion has implications for material research, gravitational research, and electrical
                    design.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I am predicting a new class of emergent materials - active materials - superalloys of
                    superconducting metals and electric charges to manipulate particle occlusion phenomena in realtime.
                </p>
                <p>An active particle occluder material has zero apparent mass.</p>

            <h2>Karl Lilje, 2020</h2>
            <p>Photons are assymetrical, their spin creates wave pertubations in the particle field. All photons spin at
                the
                maximum rate, but different shapes create different colors.</p>

            <h1>Towards Higher Speed Travel</h1>
            <h2>Karl Lilje, 2018</h2>
            <p>People often say "It is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light", which is only half true.
            </p>
            <p>The statement can be better phrased as a question - "What is stopping us from traveling faster than the
                speed of light?"</p>
            <p>Long before you reach lightspeed, your spacecraft will be ground to hot dust by particles, the cosmic
                sandblaster.
                In space, resistance to particles is defined as mass, so your craft's effective density increases until
                it
                can no longer accelerate. The maxima is in fact 50% the speed of light, limited by particle friction and
                compaction.
                In theory it is possible to move the particles out the way, creating a "portable wormhole" ahead of the
                craft.
                It will require enormous advancements in electromechanical engineering, but there is no reason it can
                not be done.</p>
            <p>Moving particles away ahead of a craft will likely reduce the density in the propellant direction,
                reducing speed. Modern rockets have a "Rose Pattern" exhaust, which assists the rocket
                in compressing particles rear of the craft to push the craft forward.
                So particles need to be channeled outside the surface of the craft where they can form as somethign to
                push against</p>
            <p>Efficient rockets do not have a smooth continuous flame, instead they make a characteristic "pop pop pop"
                as they
                create compression disks the rocket pushes against, a type of Jacob's ladder. The rocket is not pushing
                against the
                air, it is pushing against the compression disks it creates.</p>

            <h1>The Time Dilation Myth</h1>
            <h2>Karl Lilje, 2014</h2>
            <p>Traveling in space doesn't bend time</p>
            <p>The myth is propagated by movies like Interstellar, and is based on a misinterpretation of data.</p>
            <p>The idea is that a spacecraft traveling away from earth will experience a time distortion, returning in
                the distant future.</p>
            <p>The real Voyager probe sent into out space had on board a Cesium clock. Cesium clocks are
                remarkably accurate, but not perfect.</p>
            <p>A clock does not measure time, it measures the relation of two things. A dial clock measures the rotation
                of a hand against a notch. A quartz clock measures the number of blips in a piece of quartz.</p>
            <p>Cesium is a volatile substance and spontaneously combusts in air. A Cesium clock measures the number of
                cesium atoms passing through a grate and uses the amount of atoms to calibrate a quartz crystal.</p>
            <p>This works reliably on earth, but in space there is a small amount of slippage due to particle density
                differences, temperature differences, energy, etc.</p>
            <p>An area of space with lots of particle motion will have a different effect on cesium decay that the calm
                of deep space, because particles bumping into atoms changes their emission rate.</p>
            <p>So all the Voyager probe proved was the Cesium is not absolutely perfect as a clock source in deep space.
            </p>
            <p>The second misnomer is that satellites experience time distortion. However they do not distort time, their
                clocks emit at different rates for any number of reasons, including temperature shifts, particle
                density, or just sample purity.</p>
            <p>It's possible the data was simply misunderstood, or the clock manufacturer adjusted perception of the
                results to maintain its claim of zero loss, which is likely not possible.</p>
            <p>To sum up - Time does not bend, buckle, or distort (time is an artifice of the imagination), rather,
                things behave differently under different conditions.</p>

            <h1>The Theory of Normalization</h1>
            <h2>Karl Lilje, 2009</h2>
            <p>All systems, biological and physical, tend to the average.</p>
            <p>What does the salt in your food and gravity have in common? Given time they all normalize, balancing
                forces or reactions until they achieve a stable state.</p>
            <p>Entropy is not chaos, far from it, it is the normalized motion of particles, the stable state of the
                universe.</p>
