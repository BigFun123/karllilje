        <h1>Gravity is Particle Occlusion</h1>
        <h2>Karl Lilje, 2016</h3>        
        <h4>Gravity is a phenomenon caused by the occlusion of particles between atoms.</h4>
        <p>There are fewer particles between atoms than outside the couplet, resulting in a relative particle vacuum between atoms. Particles push the atoms together.</p>
        <br>
        <p> This page will illustrate and demonstate WHY gravity works, and propose ideas and applications on particle occluders that can increase the velocity maxima of suborbital, superorbital, and interstellar vehicles.</p>
        <p>Particle occlusion has implications for material research, gravitational research, and electrical design.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am predicting a new class of materials will emerge - active materials - superalloys of superconducting metals and electrical charges to manipulate particle occlusion phenomena in realtime.</p>
        <p>An active particle occluder material has zero apparent mass.</p>

        <h1>Photons are Assymetrical</h1>
        <h2>Karl Lilje, 2020</h2>
        <p>Photons are assymetrical, their spin creates wave pertubations in the particle field. All photons spin at the maximum rate, but different shapes create different colors.</p>
